AI Conversation Excerpts

Excerpt 1 – Method Overloading Concept

Prompt: “How can I overload multiple area methods for different shapes in Java?”
ChatGPT: “Each method should share the same name but differ in parameter type or count. For example, one can accept a double for a circle’s radius, another two doubles for rectangle width and height, and so on. This demonstrates compile-time polymorphism.”

Excerpt 2 – Exception Handling Guidance

Prompt: “What’s the best way to handle invalid dimensions?”
ChatGPT: “Include validation inside each method. If any dimension is zero or negative, throw an IllegalArgumentException with a clear message. This enforces correct input at runtime.”

Excerpt 3 – Static Invocation and Output Format

Prompt: “How should the Main class call these methods and display results?”
ChatGPT: “Invoke each method statically using AreaCalculator.area(...) and print the outputs in the specified format. Wrap one test in a try/catch block to demonstrate exception handling.”

Excerpt 4 – Testing and Verification

Prompt: “Can you suggest some test cases to confirm correctness?”
ChatGPT: “Test valid and invalid values for every shape. Examples include radius = 3.0 (circle), width = 5.0 and height = 2.0 (rectangle), base = 10 and height = 6 (triangle), side = 4 (square), and negative or zero inputs to trigger exceptions.”
